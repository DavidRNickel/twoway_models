# Two-way Models
This is the code for the paper "Learning-Based Two-Way Communications: Algorithmic Framework and Comparative Analysis." While ideally each directory (twbaf, twlc, twrnn) would have been collapsed into a single set of main/testing scripts, the different input output shapes needed for each model made it cleaner to just do it this way. Either way, the scripts for each model are relatively consistent. Some notes:

- Example scripts for running the models are provided in the directories. By using command line arguments, automating your training/testing experiments is pretty easy. Just fill in appropriate file-names accordingly.
- The T argument in TWLC/TWBAF is technically T_M from the paper, i.e., it is the number of channel uses assigned to each sub-block, rather than the overall block-length.
- Thank you to the authors of "Robust Non-Linear Feedback Coding via Power-Constrained Deep Learning" (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23j/kim23j.pdf) / Coding for Gaussian Two-Way Channels: Linear and Learning-Based Approaches" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00477) for providing code for the TWRNN model. We have adapted their framework to more closely resemble our original code for TWLC/TWBAF, however there still are some small discrepancies between how the frameworks run/simple variable names.
